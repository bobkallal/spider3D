# spider3D

These scripts are related to the collection and analysis of 3D surface information for schizomids conducted in R. They include obtaining shape data from 3D surfaces, moving landmarks, relating landmarks, and comparative analyses.

The surfacegen files go through the process of taking landmarked surfaces from IDAV to something usable for GMM, then performing a PCA. 'All' files include all spiders while the 'unique species' files has only one individual per species. The comparative file contains a summary of comparative analyses conducted on variations of this dataset.
